# Reapo ðŸ—ƒ

## A repo manager built with vanilla web standards ðŸŽ‰

## Purpose

Wanting a repo manager that...

- Compliments VS Code
- Built with vanilla web components & standards
- Like VS Code, is in the middle between
  - dumb (eg: OS file manager)
  - heavy (eg: gitkraken)

Reapo has some tricks already like...

- quick filter (Ctrl+F)
- quick open in VS Code
- quick new repo, Salesforce project or git clone (Ctrl+N)
  - auto opens in VS Code on creation
- quick run commands with
  - shortcut icons for ls, git sync, etc
  - or via the terminal like interface (screenshot below)

 Releases are [Releases](https://github.com/jsmithdev/reapo/releases) on GitHub.

Any todos are under [Issues](https://github.com/jsmithdev/reapo/issues) on GitHub.
