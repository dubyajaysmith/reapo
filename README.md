# Reapo ðŸ—ƒ

## A repo manager built with vanilla web standards ðŸŽ‰

## Purpose

Wanting a repo manager that:

- Compliments VS Code
- Easily editable via vanilla web standards
- Like VS Code, is in the middle between
  - dumb (eg: OS file manager)
  - heavy (eg: gitkraken)

Reapo has some tricks already like:

- quick filter
- quick open in VS Code
- quick new repo or git clone
  - auto opens in VS Code
- quick run commands with
  - shortcut icons for git sync, etc
  - or via the terminal like interface below

Early releases are [Releases](https://github.com/jsmithdev/reapo/releases) on GitHub.

Any todos are under [Issues](https://github.com/jsmithdev/reapo/issues) on GitHub.
